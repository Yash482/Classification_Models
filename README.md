# Classification_Models

Different Classification models to see clearly which one is best.
There is no rule to get the best. We have to try all. 
We apply Logistic, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification models on a dataset to check which predicts best.

This dataset contains the data of cancer patients where we have to predict the class of tumour they have.
Here also. we have all our independent features in the left columns and our dependent feature on the last column of the dataset.
